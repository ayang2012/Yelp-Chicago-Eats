I began this project with a few question in mind...

Where do I go in Chicago for the best (cajun) food? What type of food is a neighborhood known for?

In order to create this, I imagined the final product to be a tableau visualization where I would be able to filter by type of food and visualize the ranking of neighborhoods by that type. I'd also be able to see that xyz neighborhood is known for bagels etc.

## Steps
1. Build list of Chicago neighborhoods from shapefile
2. Search the Yelp API for all restaurants in the list of neighborhoods
3. Separate the data into each category per row
4. Export shapefile and csv to Tableau
5. Build a geo visualization by weighted score and filter by category
